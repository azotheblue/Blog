Knowledge is power, but how do you capture it ?

<!--more-->

## STORY

We have all been there,  we come across something and think to ourselves, "I have seen this before, but I can't quite remember" ü§î.  Perhaps during a Capture The Flag (CTF) question  or during an incident.  

So then starts the familiar journey of fanatic google searches and a flurried memory exercise to recall your data. 

What If I told you there was a better way? A way that, given enough time, can help you recall data faster and retain knowledge better.  

That way is ... Knowledge Management.  

In Short:  Pick a Tool, Build a System, and Take some Notes!

## OPENING THOUGHTS

Before we discuss what is knowledge management and more tactical discussions , let's go over  some over arching thoughts and ideas about knowledge its self.  

I love using quotes as they are distilled wisdom.  These of some of my favorite quotes in relation to the strategy  for knowledge management. 

> Anything Not saved will be lost -Nintendo Save Message

> We only know what we make - Vico

> Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original in your work - Gustave Flaubert

> It is the powering of remembering that the self's ultimate freedom consists. I am free because I remember. - Abhinavagupta


## WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE MANGEMENT

Knowledge Management  is to me the way you store and process information. For example:  When a incident closes down, what important facts and data do you keep.  More over, how to you keep?  

Here are some more important reasons to build your knowledge management system

üíæ  **RECALL** :  Being able to recall information quickly when needed. 

üìù **ORGANIZE** :  Having a system to process and store information

üï∏Ô∏è **CONNECTIONS** : With a system in place, you will be able to see connections

## TOOL

So we know that we want to create a system, but now what tool should we use? 

There are plethora of tools out there to use.  Here are a few that are you might consider for your system. However, my daily driver is Obsidian 

**Obsidian**

‚úÖLocal Storage
‚õîNo collaboration 

**Notion**

‚úÖFanastic web UI
‚õîCost per User

**EverNote**

‚úÖMultiApp Support
‚õîNo Markdown Support

If none of these fit your needs, here here a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/comments/nfef59/list_of_personal_knowledge_management_systems/) to explore more options

Try a few out and see how you like them. 

## METHODOLOGIES

This is the most important step when building a system. You system should answer the below question

> What happens when you encounter new information?

There are several system out in the wild that can help you process answer this question. However there is one that simple and easy to get started with.  

[The PARA System](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/comments/nfef59/list_of_personal_knowledge_management_systems/)

In this system you break down you file structure as below.  

- Projects
	- These are active items that you are working on
- Areas
	- These are Areas of Responsibility that you might have
- Resources
	- Data that you might need to recall 
- Archive 
	- Data that is no longer needed

I have been using this system in the Cyber field for a while  and I think it works pretty well, with some slight modifications.  This how I implement this system in the Cyber Realm at a high level.

- Project
	- Triage Notes
	- Incident Notes
	- Detection Engineering Development
- Areas
	- Meetings
	- Agenda
	- Achievements
	- Ideas
	- Planning
- Resources
	- Knowledge
		- Company Data
		- Team Data
		- Technology
			- Cloud
			- SIEM
			- EDR
- Archive  
	- Old Incidents
	- Old Triage Notes
	- Old Data 


Although I am not perfect in this regard, I try my best to capture anytime I encounter new data.  This way my knowledge base is consistently evolving.

Feel free to use this to your liking!

## THE NOTES THEMSELVES

Once you have a tool and system in place, now the question comes: "How to I take notes?".  

Although I am not an expert in note taking here some tips that I have learned along the way

- The simpler the better
	-  I have experienced that the more complicated my system becomes, the less eager I become to take notes
- Headers
	- I often use headers to separate important chunks of information

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Some final thoughts to leave you with:

üíæ ‚ÄúWhat is not saved is forgotten‚Äù 

üèóÔ∏è Start building a system ( Doesn't have to be perfect)

üìà Continuing improve over time

Eventually I believe you can have a robust and living system that will help you in your career, cyber or otherwise!
