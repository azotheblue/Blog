# INTRODUCTION

> *You rise and you follow the sound
> You wonder how all of your dreams come falling down*

For the last 3 years I have been experimenting with living with a dumb phone or a extremely restricted smart phone.  This may come as a surprise as someone working in the cybersecurity field.  Though there are some downsides, I have immense freedom without living with this oppressive technology.

Let me explain my reasoning below.  

# REASONS

**üí´Distractions** 

This is point number one. When I had a smartphone. I would constantly check my phone for messages or notifications even though I knew there was nothing coming in.  I was probably addicted to the dopamine hits these small message or notifications gave.  

Never was I alone with my thoughts. My phone would always be the solution for my boredom.  This never gave me the time to think and let my mind wonder.  Furthermore, I was not able to dive deep into work because I was  eagerly awaiting chirp from my phone.  I felt I could get nothing done.

**üîèPrivacy**

I don't like the idea of a corporate overlord knowing my every move. My phone became a data point for companies to track and further analyze my behaviors.  

**‚ûñDigital minimalism**   

When I think of the human experience, I think of hiking through strenuous trail, trying exotic new foods,  or experience a new culture. When I go through this thought exercise, a piece of technology does not enter this visual image.   Another big reason is that I choose not to use a smart phone, is that I believe my existence as a human does not revolve around the use of the technology.  

A smartphone is increasing becoming a mandatory part of everyday life:

- QR Code Scanning
- Multi Factor for Authentication
- Tickets for Events, Airline
- Portable Entertainment Devices
- Communication

Not arguing that these are great things to have. However, I am a human first. I'm not an empty chair waiting to be filled by technology.  I choose to be very selective on my uses for smart phone technologies

# CLOSING THOUGHTS / NOTES

Is it a life style  that I will continue?  I think so.  Will it be more difficult as the time progress? Absolutely!  Is it worth all the hardship?  Indubitably!
