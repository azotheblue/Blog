## INTODUCTION

This is not going to be a typical bullet style resume.  Often, a resume does not provide an opportunity for reflection.  My intention here is to have a place where I (or future employers) can ruminate upon my professional journey. 

*This is a not yet a complete professional journey.  More sections will be added as time permits*

Though my definition of a customer has changed over time, this lesson is still of great relevance today.
