## WHO AM I 

I am a cyber security professional working in the field for about the last 6 years.  
Other than that just a dude with a keyboard that likes learning and challenging my self.  

When I am not working, I thoroughly enjoy reading (see Reading List üòÅ) , anime, video games, Legos, Gunpla, board games!

## WHY A BLOG?

Embarking on this journey of sharing my thoughts in a public space is both thrilling and somewhat intimidating. Nevertheless, it's an adventure I'm eagerly embracing.

One reason that I have decide to create this is to continually challenge my self.  Writing often requires great thought and research into the subject. Not a at peer review paper level yet, so a blog it is!

The realm of cyber security constantly in flux.  Knowing something yesterday does not guarantee that you will be able to succeed tomorrow. Hence why continual learning should be the on forefront of any professionals mind, especially those in Security. 

With that, there will be mostly topics focused in the CS space.  However, that's not to say that I won't dive into other topics of interest.
