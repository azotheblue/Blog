## PRODUCTIVITY FOR THE WIN!

![Windows Meme](/blog/assets/windows-meme.png)


Little fact about me: I am a bit of a productivity nerd. If I can do it faster, more efficient, and with less thought, I am all for it. Love keyboard shorts and doing things faster with less mouse clicks. This might be a hot take, but I am a firm believer that the mouse will slow you now. üê¢

In this blog, I wanted to show you some of my favorite keyboard shortcuts and productivity tricks!

## WINDOWS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTs

These are a few of my favorite Windows Keyboard shortcuts! (Sorry Mac Users üòñ)

- **Windows Key + Arrow Keys**: Snap a Screen to the Left or Right
- **Windows Key + Shift + S** = Take a quick Screenshot that copies to the clipboard
- **Windows + .** = Emoji Menu Shortcut
- **Windows + Tab** = Window Switch
- **Window + v** = Clipboard History


## CHROMIUM TRICKS

This trick works for any Chromium based web browser (Chrome, Edge, Arc)

Consider a searchable website that you visit frequently, Amazon, for example.

What you need is the raw URL with an example of something to search for. Below is the is a simple URL that uses the search function

`https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Books`

Then you need to go to the settings of your web browser and look for the Search Engine settings. This will vary depending on your browser. For Edge, you can go to

`edge://settings/searchEngines`

Find the Add button, and click it. In the resulting modal dialog, fill in the following fields.¬†

- **Name**: ¬†Enter a name for your new search engine setting
- **Shortcut**: When you want to use this search engine, this will be the keyword you will use
- **URL**: Enter the URL to which the search request should be sent. Be sure to replace the sample search team with "%s"
