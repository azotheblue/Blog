How I organize Board Games

## WHY BOARD GAMES

In short, I play board games to foster my interaction with other humans

Board games are awesome!  I have been in the hobby for about the last 12 years!   I came into the hobby as a interesting time of my life.  I just returned from my deployment overseas and recently moved to a brand new city.  My wife had a job which required her to be gone for most of a week.  

Most of the time I was lonely and didn't have much social interaction with other humans.  I felt that I slipping away from a key pieces of my humanity.  Board Games were always a fun thing when I was a kid but never had a regular gaming group to attend and  most of the games I played were of the big store variety.  These games were boring to say the least and did not satisfy  the urning I had for more complex games. 

After some random internet browsing and I found a local board gaming group!  It was an amazing experience from the first day! And I meet some great people that I still talk to till this day.  

Sometime after, I had the  epiphany that the best way for me to interact with other humans is through the medium of board games.  Most people like to talk or have other experiences with one another to socialize, but for me the best way is through board games.  Board Games with forces  you to be in the same room with all parties agreeing  to the same form of entertainment

## THE SYSTEM

With this background, hopefully it's little more clear for methodologies for organizing board games.  Thus brings me to the main decision point in how I organize board games

> *How much interaction with other players does a game promote 

I have a 4 Tier that is based on this very question.  The more interaction it fosters the higher tier it is.  Without further adieu, here is the system.  I will dive into each Tier and provide criteria and 
examples of each category. 

- PARTY
- CO-OPERATIVE
- COMPETITIVE - ATTACK
- COMPETITIVE - POINTS

### PARTY

These types of games center on the interaction with other humans.  Sometime you might have to hide the truth or bluff your way out of a tricky situation in some of these games. Most of the time, these games are usually a hit no matter what the player composition is.

**Examples**

- [The Resistance](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance)
- [Burke's Gambit ](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/206754/burkes-gambit)
- [So Clover](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/329839/so-clover)

### COOPERATIVE

Games that require cooperation with other players to win. This grouping of games put players against the mechanics of the game itself.  These games usually promote a great deal of conversation since they require the players to work together.  

Examples

- [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic)
- [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island)
- [The Captain is Dead](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/271751/captain-dead-dangerous-planet)

### COMPETITIVE - ATTACK

![Competitive - Attack](/assets/BOARDGAMES-COMPETITIVE-ATTACK.jpg);

Games that have a mechanic where you can attack other players.  Often times when you attack other players, you aren't doing it silently. Sometimes you want to boast about your upcoming onslaught or perhaps you might need to beg for mercy from you opponent.  Either way these games provide a great avenue to converse.

Examples 

- [Cosmic Encounters](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39463/cosmic-encounter)
- [Unmatched](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295564/unmatched-game-system)
- [Spartacus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128671/spartacus-game-blood-and-treachery)

### COMPETITIVE - POINTS

![Competitive - Points](/assets/BOARDGAMES-COMPETITIVE-POINTS.jpg);

Games that are won by accumulating points in some manner.  These types of games are my least favorite as they do not foster any type of interaction.  If everyone knew the rules of the game, not much table talk would happen.  Most of the fun comes from building a strategy around how to collect the most points, which usually results in minimum table talk.

Examples

- [Ticket to Ride](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209/ticket-ride)
- [Ethnos](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/206718/ethnos)
- [Tiny Epic Galaxies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163967/tiny-epic-galaxies)

## CONCLUSION

Well there you have it, my system in detail.  Board games will always have a great deal of importance in my life because of their ability to foster interaction with others.  

Clearly, a blog post about a board game organization system isn't going to change the world. However, I thought it was a nice way to practice skills in writing and organizing thoughts around a subject I hold dear.
