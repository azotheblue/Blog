Be a Cyber Spear not an Cyber Swiss Army Knife

## THE ISSUE

Let's face it, cybersecurity is hard.   

As defenders, we require an wide breadth of knowledge.   We constantly switch back and forth from different problem sets.  For example as a SOC analyst, we might triage an alert for an endpoint one moment and as soon as that closes we switch to a analyzing a PCAP.  Even with these high level examples, analyzing a PCAP successfully requires a different  mindset than investigating malicious endpoint activity.  Even more to the point, there are entire classes one could take to dive deep into each area of analysis.  

I have unfortunately been in situation where an analyst's lack of knowledge caused the incorrect dismissal of a malicious event.  My thoughts are if that analyst had been completely focused in that area of detection, he would not of missed that event.  

With this great divide of skills between different events, does it make sense for analysts to keep a shallow mind bouncing between events?  Or perhaps we should think of how we handle alerts differently?
## A POSSIBLE SOLUTION

One solution is to develop mastery within the detection areas of a SOC.  This is a quite a departure of the common operating model.  However, I think there are some great benefits from adopting this model: 

‚úÖ Growth of Technical Expertise 
‚úÖ Reduce Burn Out 
‚úÖ Career Progression

However this model would also have some drawbacks as well

‚õî Restructuring of Organization
‚õî Time to Grow Experts
‚õî Wouldn't Work with Small Organizations

## WHY?

Over the course of a the last few years, I have been continually asking myself one question: "How does one become an expert?" This question has lead me to read numerous books and question my own career growth.  

One book I have read that made me think of expertise differently was the book [The Intellectual Life](https://a.co/d/fcy135K).  One quote stuck out to me from this book:

> In other words we must understand everything, but in order to succeed in doing some one thing" 

The same point cane be made about Cyber Security.  As defenders, we have a wide area of knowledge that we need, but in order to fully understand an attack we need to start specializing. Over time, the evolution of technology leads to increased complexity, posing a challenge for defenders to grasp all necessary aspects comprehensively.  

Hence why I believe we need to start growing expertise in our ranks rather than shallow knowers.  
## HOW IT WOULD LOOK?

So how would this model look? 

First, we would need to understand our Detection Areas.  Below is not an exhaustive list but let's just say we have the below detection areas in our SOC.

- üíª Endpoint
- üåê Network
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud

A typical model of a SOC would look like the below image.  One analyst needs to know understand multiple areas of detection.

What I am proposing is that an each detection area would have its own analyst

The amount of people you need would vary depending on how many detection areas you will need to cover.  For example, If you have 3 detection areas that you would like to cover, and have 3 - 8 hours shifts during the day, would likely need 15 people to cover this type of model.

## WRAPPING UP 

This blog isn't going to make big waves in the cyber security industry.  My goal here was share an idea in my head to all who would like to read.  In a future blog, I will detail how I think this idea could be accomplished.  Stay tuned!
